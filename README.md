In this homework, I continued exploring COVID-19 in the world.
While in the previous homework I focused on 4 countries(China, Israel, Italy, USA] and only about confirmed cases since the first day it appeared in that country, in this homework I will be focusing on all the countries and I will be answering the following question - How good is the healthcare system and the way the country handles the pandemic.
The metric Iâ€™ll be using to answer this question would be the percentage of deaths from people who had the virus, meaning the number of deaths divided by the number of people who have the virus.

At this time, I decided to show the values on a map of the world, which might also teach us something about the area where the countries are based. Also, I will be comparing by date(and not the relative day since COVID-19 first appeared in that country).

My visualization is interactive in the following ways:
* It has a slider that represents dates
    * It can be played and paused
    * You can move the slider to a specific date
* It shows a legend of all the countries which can be filtered using the legend on the right side
    * Double click on a country will display on the clicked country
        * Any other country clicked afterwards is added to the displayed countries
        * Double click again will reset the filter and show all the countries
    * A single click un-shows the country on the map
* You can zoom in and out
* You can take a snapshot of the graph(Download the image as a png)
* You have a mouseover description display
